<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed includes two watersheds with nested sub-basins: 
the North Fork (NFC, 484 ha) and South Fork (SFC, 424 ha). This page is a beta test page for public use access to
hydrological, bioclimatic, morphological, biological and anthropogenic forest disturbance reserach data.
<br/><br/>
Initially this search page will include temperature and rainfall data query functionality using dynamic map pages
and direct topical search. It will evetually be expanded to include other forest data as well as regression and timeseries
charting capabilities.
<br/><br/>
There are two permanent temperature data collection stations located within the Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed:
Data has been collected since 1996 at station Arfstein (arf) in the North Fork, and since 1998 at Quetelet (que)
in the South Fork. This data comprises hourly air and water temperatures.
Daily minimum, maximum and mean air and water temperatures are found under recorded daily.
<br/><br/>
There are three permanent rainfall data collection stations located within the Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed:
North Fork 408 (nfc408), North Fork 620 (nfc620), and South Fork 620 (sfc620). This data comprises three types of files:
instantaneous (time of each 0.01-inch tip), daily (total rainfall per day), and table (a single page of daily rainfall for each year).

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<p>The Caspar Creek data collection station network is designed to study the effects of harvest practices 
on forest watershed and ecological processes. From 1963 to 1967, both the NFC and SFC 
watersheds were calibrated prior to treatment. At that time, these watersheds supported a 90-year-old,
second-growth, mixed conifer forest dominated by coastal redwood (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>) and
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>). From 1967 to 1972, roads were constructed and about two-thirds of the
stand volume was selectively harvested and tractor yarded from SFC. From 1985 to 1986, 67 percent of an
87-ha ungauged tributary was clearcut and cable yarded immediately upstream of the North Fork gauging station.
Logging began in the main study portion of the NFC in 1989 and ended in 1991. Three 
tributaries in the NFC were left in an untreated control condition.</p>
